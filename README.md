# honey-organics

Please consider the following recommendations:

<b>Honey Organics is the project that is built to show the skills and taste of my work to the potential employer.
So, the changes or distribution of code is not appreciated and I want you to do avoid such activities with the code because I want to show my work to employer not someone else's contribution.
But you can still see the code and learn from it.</b>
